### Description <a name="description"></a>  
  The backend database is tailored for e-commerce websites, leveraging Express.js API and Sequelize to interface with the MySQL database. This backend infrastructure empowers users to establish a development database, populate it with test data, and synchronize Sequelize models with the MySQL database. Users are equipped with the capability to utilize GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for viewing and managing data within the database. Take it for a spin and witness how it propels your company to new heights!

### Installation

To begin, either clone the repository from GitHub or download the zip folder directly from the repository. Next, open the obtained repository in your chosen source code editor. Within the integrated terminal of the editor, execute the installation guides provided in the "Built With" section to ensure seamless functionality of the cloned documentation.

### How to use <a name="usage"></a> 

* Begin by accessing the repository. Execute 'npm i' to install dependencies, then update the '.env' file with necessary environment variables.

* To create the database, utilize the 'schema.sql' file located in the 'db' folder. Execute MySQL shell commands. Ensure sensitive data such as MySQL username, password, and database name are stored in environment variables.

* Seed the database with test data by running 'npm run seed'. Subsequently, initiate the server by running either 'npm start' or 'nodemon'. This action will synchronize Sequelize models with the MySQL database.

* For development purposes, generate a development database with test data using the schema and seed commands.

* Utilize Insomnia to test 'http://localhost:3001' by accessing the following route endpoints: API GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for categories, products, and tags. Verify successful creation, updating, and deletion of data within the database.
